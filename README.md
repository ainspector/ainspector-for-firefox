# AInspector WCAG

AInspector WCAG is a port of [AInspector Sidebar](https://ainspector.github.io/) to use the web extension APIs for the Firefox browser.  Firefox was chosen to port to first, since Firefox supports the the sidebar API and Chrome does not.  The extension is available in the Firefox add-ons page.
