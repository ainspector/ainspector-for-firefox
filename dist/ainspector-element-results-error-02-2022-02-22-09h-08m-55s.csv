"Details / Action"
"Rule ID","ERROR 2"
"Summary","Required form controls"
"Definition","If user input is required for a form control the REQUIRED or ARIA-REQUIRED attribute must must used."
"Action","MC: If the form control is required, add the REQUIRED attribute or if HTML4 compatibility is required the ARIA-REQUIRED=""TRUE"" attribute."
"","H: The 5 form control elements that are hidden do not need to be tested for being required."
"Purpose","Users benefit from information being informed if a input to a control is required for form submission or task completion."
"Techniques","To identify a required form control, add the HTML5 REQUIRED attribute to the standard form controls."
"","If compatibility with HTML4 standards or legacy browsers and assistve technologies, you can also use ARIA-REQUIRED=""TRUE"" to indicate a form control is required."
"","Use the REQUIRED attribute (or the ARIA-REQUIRED if used) as the CSS selector for visually styling the form control as required.  This ensures that the visual state stays synchronized with the accessibility API state used by assistive technologies."
"","The only reason to support both REQUIRED and ARIA-REQUIRED on the same form control is to support legacy browsers and assistive technologies.  This required extra care to make sure the two values do not conflict.  If they do conflict the REQUIRED attribute will override the ARIA-REQUIRED property value."
